# Word-Document Locker (macros)
This is a basic VBA program that password protects all docx files in a selected folder.

Instructions for Running the Macro:

Before You Start:

Backup Your Documents: Before running the macro, make sure to back up all the Word documents you plan to password protect. This is a precautionary measure to prevent any accidental loss of data.

Ensure that you are in developer mode.

Steps to Run the Macro:
1.	Open the Provided Word Document:

Double-click on the Word document I provided you with. This document contains the macro.
2.	Enable Macros (if prompted):

If a security warning about macros appears, click on "Enable Content" or "Enable Macros." This step is essential for the macro to run. If you trust the source of the document (in this case, the document I sent you), it's safe to enable macros.

3.	Access the Macro:

Go to the View tab in the ribbon.
Click on Macros in the Macros group.
Choose View Macros.
Run the Macro:

In the list of macros, you should see ProtectDocumentsWithOpenPasswordAndFolderPicker. Select it.
Click Run.
4.	Select a Folder:

A window will open prompting you to select the folder containing the Word documents you want to password protect. Navigate to the folder, select it, and then click OK.
5.	Enter the Password:

A small input box will appear asking for a password. Enter the password you wish to use for protecting your documents. Remember this password, as you will need it to open the protected documents later.


6.	Wait for Completion:

The macro will start processing the documents. This may take some time, depending on the number of documents and their size.
A message will pop up once all documents have been processed, indicating that the task is complete.
7.	After Running the Macro:
Check the Protected Documents: In the folder you selected, you will find new versions of your documents prefixed with "Protected_". These are the password-protected copies of your original documents.
Verify Document Accessibility: Try opening one of the new "Protected_" documents to ensure they are password-protected and accessible with the password you set.
